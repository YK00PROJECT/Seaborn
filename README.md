# Seaborn Visualization Gallery

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Seaborn Visualization Gallery! This repository is a curated collection of scripts that demonstrate how to create various statistical data visualizations using Seaborn, a powerful and versatile visualization library in Python. The examples cover a broad range of graph types, from simple univariate plots to complex multivariate visualizations.

## Visualization Types Included
This repository includes examples for the following types of Seaborn plots:

- **Swarm Plot:** Avoids overlap and shows all data points.
- **Point Plot:** Displays point estimates and confidence intervals.
- **Cat Plot:** General plot type for categorical variables.
- **Univariate Plots:** Visualizations of single variables.
- **KDE Plot:** Kernel Density Estimate plots for visualizing the distribution of observations.
- **Rug Plot:** Plots a tick for every individual observation along an axis.
- **Box Plot:** Visualizes the distribution of quantitative data.
- **Violin Plot:** Combines aspects of box plots and KDE plots.
- **Strip Plot:** Draws a scatterplot where one variable is categorical.
- **Dist Plot:** Combines KDE and histogram.
- **Bivariate Plots:** Plots relating two variables.
- **Regression Plot:** Plots a regression line to show the relationship between two variables.
- **Joint Plot:** Combines two univariate plots.
- **Hexbin Plot:** Uses hexagons to represent the density of points.
- **Multivariate Plots:** Shows relationships among multiple variables.
- **Relational Plot:** Visualizes statistical relationships between data points.

## Repository Contents
Each plot type has its own script, making it easy to understand and replicate the examples:

- **Scripts:** Individual `.py` files for each plot type.
- **Data:** Sample data sets used in the plots.
- **Requirements:** Specifications of libraries and tools required to run the scripts.
